# A COVID-19 contact tracing app that honours civil liberty

We propose a voluntary COVID-19 Contact Tracing and Notification Platform. The app asks, “How are you feeling?” because we all care how each other are feeling. We want to know because we are afraid to go out for fear of an unseen virus. We want to know because we want help for our loved ones if they fall ill. We want to know because we want to feel safe. We want to know how you are feeling because we are concerned for your health. We want all this while maintaining confidence in our enduring freedom.
