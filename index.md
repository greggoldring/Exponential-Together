# A COVID-19 contact tracing app that honours civil liberty

We propose a voluntary COVID-19 Contact Tracing and Notification Platform. The app asks, “How are you feeling?” because we all care how each other are feeling. We want to know because we are afraid to go out for fear of an unseen virus. We want to know because we want help for our loved ones if they fall ill. We want to know because we want to feel safe. We want to know how you are feeling because we are concerned for your health. We want all this while maintaining confidence in our enduring freedom.

## Problem

/As a _____, I want _____ so that ____ stories/

As a **citizen**, I want to be able to share my location history with public health so that I can be informed if I have visited a location that puts me at risk of contracting COVID-19.

As a **citizen**, I want to be able to share my location history with public health so that others can be quickly informed that they are at risk of contracting COVID-19 and can take extra precautions to protect the people they regularly come in contact with.

As a **public health authority**, I want to know as quickly as possible where infected citizens have been and whom they may have been in contact with. 

As a **citizen**, I want to be able to stop sharing my location history with my government after the epidemic has passed so that my civil liberties are not jeopardized. 

##Background
Transmission can occur in the following ways:
1. Direct person-to-person (being in close proximity at the same time).
2. Indirect via infected locations/surfaces (being in the same location as the infected person, and up to 72 hours after them) 
3. Indirect via infected objects/surfaces that change location (parcels, public transportation, etc) 

##Solution
An app that checks your wellbeing at regular intervals and screens you for symptoms of COVID-19. The app rewards you for participation and encourages you share the app with friends and check in on eachother if you aren't participating (presumably because you are feeling unwell). Before you venture out, you receive guidance on the precautions you should take and zones you should not visit. Zones are places outside your home where people typically intermingle such as businesses and public buildings. When you venture out, the app records your visits to zones and logs each time you come in close proximity to another app user. Collectively, all app users’ recent visits to zones are anonymously recorded and tagged with their health status. The anonymous logs of people they come in contact with are as well. When a person who recently visited a zone before you or came in close contact with you reports that they are infected, you and the other people they came in contact with are notified. The notifications include instructions on the steps they need to take to protect themselves and the people around them. So too when a /cluster/ of people who have visited a zone or been in proximity with someone you’ve been in close contact with begin /exhibiting symptoms/, you will receive a notification and guidance on the precautions you should take.
For public health authorities, this app gives granular and predictive insight for contact tracing.
