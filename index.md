# A COVID-19 contact tracing app that honours civil liberty

We propose a voluntary COVID-19 Contact Tracing and Notification Platform. The app asks, “How are you feeling?” because we all care how each other are feeling. We want to know because we are afraid to go out for fear of an unseen virus. We want to know because we want help for our loved ones if they fall ill. We want to know because we want to feel safe. We want to know how you are feeling because we are concerned for your health. We want all this while maintaining confidence in our enduring freedom.

## Problem

/As a _____, I want _____ so that ____ stories/

As a **citizen**, I want to be able to share my location history with public health so that I can be informed if I have visited a location that puts me at risk of contracting COVID-19.

As a **citizen**, I want to be able to share my location history with public health so that others can be quickly informed that they are at risk of contracting COVID-19 and can take extra precautions to protect the people they regularly come in contact with.

As a **public health authority**, I want to know as quickly as possible where infected citizens have been and whom they may have been in contact with. 

As a **citizen**, I want to be able to stop sharing my location history with my government after the epidemic has passed so that my civil liberties are not jeopardized. 

##Background
Transmission can occur in the following ways:
1. Direct person-to-person (being in close proximity at the same time).
2. Indirect via infected locations/surfaces (being in the same location as the infected person, and up to 72 hours after them) 
3. Indirect via infected objects/surfaces that change location (parcels, public transportation, etc)
